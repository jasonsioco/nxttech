This object is necessary if automatic authentication is not available in your environment.\n\nEverything from the [gcloud-node Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-node/#/authentication) applies here.\n\nAt a glance, the supported properties for this method are:\n\n- `keyFilename` - Path to a .json, .pem, or .p12 key file\n- `credentials` - Object containing `client_email` and `private_key` properties\n- `scopes` - Required scopes for the desired API request\n\nFor more details, see the Authentication Guide linked above, under \"The config object\".\n\n#### auth.authorizeRequest(reqOpts, callback)\n\nExtend an HTTP request object with an authorized header.\n\n##### callback(err, authorizedReqOpts)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Error`\n\nAn API error or an error if scopes are required for the request you're trying to make (check for err.code = `MISSING_SCOPE`). If you receive the missing scope error, provide the `authConfig.scopes` array with the necessary scope URLs for your request. There are examples of scopes that are required for some of the Google Cloud Platform services in the [gcloud-node Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-node/#/authentication).\n\n###### callback.authorizedReqOpts\n\n- Type: `Object`\n\nThe reqOpts object provided has been extended with a valid access token attached to the `headers.Authorization` value. E.g.: `headers.Authorization = 'Bearer y.2343...'`.\n\n#### auth.getAuthClient(callback)\n\nGet the auth client instance from [google-auth-library](http://gitnpm.com/googleauth).\n\n##### callback(err, authClient)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Error`\n\nAn error that occurred while trying to get an authorization client.\n\n###### callback.authClient\n\n- Type: [`google-auth-library`](http://gitnpm.com/googleauth)\n\nThe client instance from [google-auth-library](http://gitnpm.com/googleauth).

The token will always be current. If necessary, background refreshes are handled automatically.\n\n##### callback(err, token)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Error`\n\nAn API error or an error if scopes are required for the request you're trying to make (check for err.code = `MISSING_SCOPE`).

There are examples of scopes that are required for some of the Google Cloud Platform services in the [gcloud-node Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-node/#/authentication).\n\n###### callback.token\n\n- Type: `String`\n\nA current access token to be used during an API request.\n\n\n#### auth.isAppEngine(callback)\n\nDetermine if the environment the app is running in is a Google App Engine instance.\n\n##### callback(err, isAppEngine)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Null`\n\nWe won't return an error, but it's here for convention-sake.\n\n###### callback.isAppEngine\n\n- Type: `Boolean`\n\nWhether the app is in App Engine or not.\n\n\n#### auth.isCloudFunction(callback)\n\nDetermine if the environment the app is running in is a Google Cloud Function.\n\n##### callback(err, isCloudFunction)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Null`\n\nWe won't return an error, but it's here for convention-sake.\n\n###### callback.isCloudFunction\n\n- Type: `Boolean`\n\nWhether the app is in a Cloud Function or not.\n\n\n#### auth.isComputeEngine(callback)\n\nDetermine if the environment the app is running in is a Google Compute Engine instance.\n\n##### callback(err, isComputeEngine)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Null`\n\nWe won't return an error, but it's here for convention-sake.\n\n###### callback.isComputeEngine\n\n- Type: `Boolean`\n\nWhether the app is in a Compute Engine instance or not.\n\n\n#### auth.isContainerEngine(callback)\n\nDetermine if the environment the app is running in is a Google Container Engine instance.\n\n##### callback(err, isContainerEngine)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Null`\n\nWe won't return an error, but it's here for convention-sake.\n\n###### callback.isContainerEngine\n\n- Type: `Boolean`\n\nWhether the app is in a Container Engine instance or not.\n","maintainers":[{"email":"github-admin@google.com","name":"google-admin"},{"email":"jason.dobry@gmail.com","name":"jdobry"},{"email":"jj@geewax.org","name":"jgeewax"},{"email":"callmehiphop@gmail.com","name":"callmehiphop"},{"email":"sawchuk@gmail.com","name":"stephenplusplus"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T21:08:53.047Z","created":"2015-08-11T20:56:38.282Z","0.1.0":"2015-08-11T20:56:38.282Z","0.1.1":"2015-08-21T23:09:01.830Z","0.2.0":"2015-08-26T02:26:12.311Z","0.2.1":"2015-08-26T02:58:00.287Z","0.2.2":"2015-09-21T15:49:58.926Z","0.2.3":"2015-11-14T01:53:33.873Z","0.2.4":"2016-02-16T19:49:28.984Z","0.3.0":"2016-10-19T13:48:32.724Z","0.4.0":"2016-11-15T15:08:42.949Z","0.5.0":"2016-11-23T11:49:49.967Z","0.5.1":"2016-11-28T17:00:36.971Z","0.5.2":"2016-11-29T15:49:46.483Z","0.5.3":"2017-03-14T01:21:32.263Z","0.5.4":"2017-03-15T17:00:29.331Z","0.6.0":"2017-03-29T12:20:13.379Z","0.6.1":"2017-04-24T17:20:20.161Z","0.7.0":"2017-04-27T16:50:36.827Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/stephenplusplus/google-auto-auth#readme","keywords":["google","authentication","jwt","service","account","googleapis","gcloud","cloud","gce","compute","engine","auth","access","token"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/stephenplusplus/google-auto-auth.git"},"author":{"name":"Stephen Sawchuk","email":"sawchuk@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stephenplusplus/google-auto-auth/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"59235365-8668\"","_lastModified":"Mon, 22 May 2017 21:08:53 GMT"}
