stubs\n\n> It's a simple stubber.\n\n## About\n\nFor when you don't want to write the same thing over and over to cache a method and call an override, then revert it, and blah blah.\n\n\n## Use\n```sh\n$ npm install --save-dev stubs\n```\n```js\nvar mylib = require('./lib/index.js')\nvar stubs = require('stubs')\n\n// make it a noop\nstubs(mylib, 'create')\n\n// stub it out\nstubs(mylib, 'create', function() {\n  // calls this instead\n})\n\n// stub it out, but call the original first\nstubs(mylib, 'create', { callthrough: true }, function() {\n  // call original method, then call this\n})\n\n// use the stub for a while, then revert\nstubs(mylib, 'create', { calls: 3 }, function() {\n  // call this 3 times, then use the original method\n})\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### stubs(object, method[[, opts], stub])\n\n#### object\n- Type: Object\n\n#### method\n- Type: String\n\nName of the method to stub.\n\n#### opts\n- (optional)\n- Type: Object\n\n##### opts.callthrough\n- (optional)\n- Type: Boolean\n- Default: `false`\n\nCall the original method as well as the stub (if a stub is provided).\n\n##### opts.calls\n- (optional)\n- Type: Number\n- Default: `0` (never revert)\n\nNumber of calls to allow the stub to receive until reverting to the original.\n\n#### stub\n- (optional)\n- Type: Function\n- Default: `function() {}`\n\nThis method is called in place of the original method. If `opts.callthrough` is `true`, this method is called *after* the original method is called as well.","maintainers":[{"name":"stephenplusplus","email":"sawchuk@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-01-13T15:12:29.416Z","created":"2014-10-16T22:48:46.172Z","1.0.0":"2014-10-16T22:48:46.172Z","1.1.0":"2014-10-16T23:17:25.506Z","1.1.1":"2014-10-17T02:41:30.271Z","1.1.2":"2014-10-17T04:03:02.369Z","2.0.0":"2015-07-07T20:11:53.795Z","3.0.0":"2017-01-13T15:12:29.416Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/stephenplusplus/stubs","keywords":["stubs"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/stephenplusplus/stubs.git"},"author":{"name":"Stephen Sawchuk"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stephenplusplus/stubs/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5878ee5d-1e46\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 15:12:29 GMT"}
