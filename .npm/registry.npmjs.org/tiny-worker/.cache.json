tiny-worker\nTiny WebWorker for Server\n\n`require()` is available for flexible inline Worker scripts. Optional parameters `args` Array & `options` Object; see `child_process.fork()` documentation.\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/avoidwork/tiny-worker.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/avoidwork/tiny-worker)\n\n## Example\n#### Creating a Worker from a file\nThe worker script:\n```javascript\nonmessage = function (ev) {\n\tpostMessage(ev.data);\n};\n```\n\nThe core script:\n```javascript\nvar Worker = require(\"tiny-worker\");\nvar worker = new Worker(\"repeat.js\");\n\nworker.onmessage = function (ev) {\n\tconsole.log(ev.data);\n\tworker.terminate();\n};\n\nworker.postMessage(\"Hello World!\");\n```\n\n#### Creating a Worker from a Function\n```javascript\nvar Worker = require(\"tiny-worker\");\nvar worker = new Worker(function () {\n\tself.onmessage = function (ev) {\n\t\tpostMessage(ev.data);\n\t};\n});\n\nworker.onmessage = function (ev) {\n\tconsole.log(ev.data);\n\tworker.terminate();\n};\n\nworker.postMessage(\"Hello World!\");\n```\n\n# Debugging\nTo be able to debug a child process, it must have a differnt debug port than the parent. \nTiny worker does this by adding a random port within a range to the parents debug port.\nThe default Range is `[1, 300]`, it can be changed with the `setRange(min, max)` method.\nTo disable any automatic port redirection set `options.noDebugRedirection = true`.\n\n### automatic redirection\n```javascript\n//parent is started with '--debug=1234'\nvar Worker = require(\"tiny-worker\");\nWorker.setRange(2, 20);\n\nvar worker = new Worker(function () {\n\tpostMessage(process.debugPort); \n});\n\nworker.onmessage = function (ev) {\n\tconsole.log(ev.data); //prints any number between 1236 and 1254\n\tworker.terminate();\n}\n```\n\n### manual redirection\n```javascript\n//parent is started with '--debug=1234'\nvar Worker = require(\"tiny-worker\");\n\nvar worker = new Worker(function () {\n\tpostMessage(process.debugPort); \n}, [], {noDebugRedirection: true, execArgv: [\"--debug=1235\"]});\n\nworker.onmessage = function (ev) {\n\tconsole.log(ev.data); //prints 1235\n\tworker.terminate();\n}\n```\n\n## Properties\n#### onmessage\nMessage handler, accepts an `Event`\n\n#### onerror\nError handler, accepts an `Event`\n\n## API\n#### addEventListener(event, fn)\nAdds an event listener\n\n#### postMessage()\nBroadcasts a message to the `Worker`\n\n#### terminate()\nTerminates the `Worker`\n\n#### static setRange(min, max)\nSets range for debug ports, only affects current process.\nReturns true if successful.\n\n## FAQ\n1. I have an orphaned child process that lives on past the parent process' lifespan\n  * Most likely a `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` is not reaching the child process\n2. How do I insure all process are terminated?\n  * In your core script register a listener for `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` via `process.on()` which terminates (all) worker process(es) and then gracefully shutdowns via `process.exit(0);`\n3. Why `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`?\n  * Unix/BSD will work with `SIGTERM`, but if you also need to support Windows use `SIGINT`\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Jason Mulligan\nLicensed under the BSD-3 license\n","maintainers":[{"name":"avoidwork","email":"jason.mulligan@avoidwork.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-05-10T13:13:46.751Z","created":"2015-09-29T22:28:15.636Z","0.1.0":"2015-09-29T22:28:15.636Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-30T00:41:27.642Z","1.0.1":"2015-09-30T00:43:30.294Z","1.0.2":"2015-09-30T00:44:54.912Z","1.0.3":"2015-09-30T00:47:23.047Z","1.0.4":"2015-09-30T10:45:58.386Z","1.1.0":"2015-10-14T15:41:40.633Z","1.1.1":"2015-10-14T20:28:35.238Z","1.1.2":"2016-06-15T23:28:43.661Z","1.1.3":"2016-06-15T23:34:50.957Z","1.1.4":"2016-06-15T23:39:25.073Z","1.1.5":"2016-08-05T11:04:43.510Z","1.1.6":"2016-10-03T11:59:25.783Z","1.1.7":"2016-10-03T12:20:37.359Z","2.0.0":"2017-01-05T01:29:37.119Z","2.0.1":"2017-01-05T01:38:19.230Z","2.0.2":"2017-03-05T15:42:01.405Z","2.0.3":"2017-03-13T01:33:24.686Z","2.1.0":"2017-04-20T11:29:53.579Z","2.1.1":"2017-05-04T12:07:01.456Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/avoidwork/tiny-worker","keywords":["web","worker","ps","webworker"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/avoidwork/tiny-worker.git"},"author":{"name":"Jason Mulligan","email":"jason.mulligan@avoidwork.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/avoidwork/tiny-worker/issues"},"license":"BSD-3-Clause","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"hugov":true,"ys_sidson_aidson":true,"shanewholloway":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5913120a-794c\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 10 May 2017 13:13:46 GMT","_cached":true}
